# e2-showcase

Scientific showcase and images for everything2

[everything2] is a fantastic site. It's also old, and has never
supported images.

Sometimes, some of the writeups there could&mdash;indeed *should*&mdash;benefit
from properly formatted mathematical formulae and
programatically-created images.

This repository is an add-on, a [lamprey]-like addition to e2. It's not
meant to replace it, but to live on a different, parallel plane.

If you're a noder and wish to contribute here, please do follow these
guidelines:

1.  Your source code will be released under the [MIT license] so please
    only submit code that you have the legal rights to share
2.  Please make your code as self-contained as possible
3.  Please do indicate which node and writeup your code is meant to
    illustrate

The current owner and maintainer of this repository is @andycyca, both

Media LLC, the e2 gods, or anything of the sort. However, **[EDB] has no
power here!**
